This discussion section serves to introduce students to the process we
will be using to compile, cross-compile, test, and evaluate C programs
running on the single- and multi-core processors we will be building in
Lab 4. You should log into the `ecelinux` servers using the remote access
option of your choice and then source the setup script.

    % source setup-ece4750.sh
    % mkdir -p $HOME/ece4750
    % cd $HOME/ece4750
    % git clone git@github.com:cornell-ece4750/ece4750-sec11-sys sec11
    % cd sec11
    % TOPDIR=$PWD

TinyRV2 Single-Core Processor Walk-Through
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following figure shows the high-level interface for our TinyRV2
single-core system. We compose the pipelined processor implemented in Lab
2 (which includes the multiplier from Lab 1) with two instances of the
cache implemented in Lab 3 to serve as the instruction cache and data
cache. There are also mngr2proc and proc2mngr stream interfaces for
testing purposes. All interfaces are implemented using the
latency-insensitive val/rdy micro-protocol.

Natively Compiling a C Test Program
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

In Lab 2, you used hand-coded assembly programs to evaluate your
pipelined processor. Obviously this is quite tedious and error prone. In
Lab 4, you will be writing C programs and cross-compiling them to run on
your single-core and multi-core systems.

**IMPORTANT: It is absolutely critical that you _thoroughly_ test all of
  your C programs by natively compiling and executing them before even
  thinking of executing these programs on your single-core or multi-core
  system!**

When we say "natively compiling and executing" what we mean is that you
have tested your program by compiling it on `ecelinux` for x86 and then
executed this program on the `ecelinux` server (i.e., just like any
regular C program). Why is this so important? Because trying to debug an
error in your C program when executing the C program on a simulator is
_very_ painful. It is much easier (and faster!) to debug your C program
using native execution.

Let's try compiling a C program from the command line. First enter the
following simple C program into a file named `hello.c`:

    #include <stdio.h>

    int main( void )
    {
      printf("hello world!");
    }

Then you can compile and execute this program like this:

    % gcc -o hello hello.c
    % ./hello

We are using `gcc` as the native compiler. Manually compiling programs
from the command line like this is tedious and error prone. We can
automate this process using a _build system_. More specifically, we will
be using a Makefile to automate the process of compiling,
cross-compiling, linking, and executing C programs. The build system and
all of the C source code for Lab 4 will be in the `app` subdirectory;
let's take a look at this subdirectory:

    % cd $TOPDIR/app
    % tree

In this discussion section, we will be starting with the code in
`app/simple` and also take a quick look at the code in `app/ubmark`. We
provide a very simple ece4750 standard C library in `app/ece4750` which
enables printing, dynamic memory allocation, pseudo random number
generation, exiting the program, and unit testing. Remember that our
systems do not run an operating system. You cannot use the "real"
standard C library, read/write files, process complex command line
arguments, etc. We can only write simple "bare-metal" C programs.

Let's take a look at the simple C program in
`app/simple/simple-avg-adhoc.c` with a function that averages two
integers:

    #include "ece4750.h"

    __attribute__ ((noinline))
    int avg( int x, int y )
    {
      int sum = x + y;
      return sum / 2;
    }

    int main( void )
    {
      int a = 10;
      int b = 20;
      int c = avg( a, b );

      ece4750_wprintf( L"average of %d and %d is %d\n", a, b, c );

      return 0;
    }

First, notice how we include the `ece4750.h` header which gives us access
to the very simple ece4750 standard C library. We are using a `noinline`
attribute to prevent the C compiler from inlining this function; this
makes it easier for us to see the assembly corresponding to this
function. Notice how we are using `ece4750_wprintf` instead of `printf`.
This is because `printf` uses regular ASCII character strings which are
stored as arrays of bytes. If we try to read/write a regular ASCII
character string this will result in byte load/stores but TinyRV2 only
supports 4B word load/stores! So we will instead always use "wide
characters" which is stored as a 4B word. You will need to use the `L`
prefix in front of all string literals. You can always look in the
ece4750 standard library to learn more about how these functions are
implemented.

Let's use the build system to compile this simple C program. We _always_
start by creating a build directory, just like we do when testing and
evaluating our RTL models. We want to keep generated files separate from
source files.

    % mkdir -p $TOPDIR/app/build-native
    % cd $TOPDIR/app/build-native
    % ../configure

We name the build directory `build-native` to clearly indicate that this
is where we will be doing native compilation. The `configure` script uses
the `app/Makefile.in` template to create a specialized `Makefile` for
this build. Now we can go ahead and compile the simple C program.

    % cd $TOPDIR/app/build-native
    % make simple-avg-adhoc
    % objdump -dC ./simple-avg-adhoc

You can see from `objdump` that this is an x86 binary (not a TinyRV2
binary!). Now let's execute the program.

    % cd $TOPDIR/app/build-native
    % ./simple-avg-adhoc

Hopefully no surprises. This simple C program is an example of "ad-hoc
testing". We write a program, try some inputs, and print the outputs. We
can manually verify that the outputs are correct. We argued previously in
the semester that ad-hoc testing is insufficient for hardware, and all
those same reasons apply to software. We must use a systematic and
automatic unit testing strategy to verify that our software is correct.
We provide you a simple unit testing framework to make this relatively
easy.

First, you will need to keep the function under test in a separate file.
This way we can use modular compilation to compile the function and link
it against our test program and then later link it against an evaluation
program for final performance analysis. Take a look at the
`app/simple/simple-avg.h` and `app/simple/simple-avg.c` files; the header
file contains the function declaration (i.e., the interface for the
function) and the C source file contains the function definition (i.e.,
the implementation for the function). Now let's look at the test program
in `app/simple/simple-avg-test.c`:

    #include "ece4750.h"
    #include "simple-avg.h"

    void test_case_1_pos_pos_even()
    {
      ECE4750_CHECK( L"test_case_1_pos_pos_even" );

      ECE4750_CHECK_INT_EQ( avg(   4,   8 ),   6 );
      ECE4750_CHECK_INT_EQ( avg( 100, 200 ), 150 );
      ECE4750_CHECK_INT_EQ( avg(  37,  53 ),  45 );
    }

    ...

    int main( int argc, char** argv )
    {
      __n = ( argc == 1 ) ? 0 : ece4750_atoi( argv[1] );

      if ( (__n <= 0) || (__n == 1) ) test_case_1_pos_pos_even();
      if ( (__n <= 0) || (__n == 2) ) test_case_2_pos_pos_odd();
      if ( (__n <= 0) || (__n == 3) ) test_case_3_neg_neg_even();
      if ( (__n <= 0) || (__n == 4) ) test_case_4_neg_neg_odd();
      if ( (__n <= 0) || (__n == 5) ) test_case_5_pos_neg_even();
      if ( (__n <= 0) || (__n == 6) ) test_case_6_pos_neg_odd();

      ece4750_wprintf( L"\n\n" );
      return ece4750_check_status;
    }

Each test case is a separate function. You should use the `ECE4750_CHECK`
macro with a string which indicates the name of this test case. Then you
can use additional `ECE4750_CHECK` macros to check various properties of
your C program.

  - `ECE4750_CHECK_FAIL` : force a test case failure
  - `ECE4750_CHECK_TRUE` : check if an expression is true
  - `ECE4750_CHECK_FALSE` : check if an expression is false
  - `ECE4750_CHECK_INT_EQ` : check if two expressions are equal

You need to make sure to modify the `main` function to call each test
case using the pattern shown above. Let's compile and run this test
program:

    % cd $TOPDIR/app/build-native
    % make simple-avg-test
    % ./simple-avg-test -1
    % ./simple-avg-test
    % ./simple-avg-test 1

The test program takes a single integer command line argument. `-1` means
to print the name of each test case but not to actually run the test
cases. With no command line argument, the test program will run all of
the tests. You can also specify a single test case number to run on the
command line. A little green dot indicates that one of the
`ECE4750_CHECK` macros passed. It is very convenient to build and run a
unit test with a single command like this:

    % cd $TOPDIR/app/build-native
    % make simple-avg-test && ./simple-avg-test

This way you can rerun the test by just pressing the up arrow key and
enter. You can run all of the test cases associated with a specific
subproject like this:

    % cd $TOPDIR/app/build-native
    % make check-simple

And you can run all of the test cases across all subprojects like this:

    % cd $TOPDIR/app/build-native
    % make check

Cross-Compiling Compiling a C Test Program
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now that we know our simple C program works natively, we can try
cross-compiling it and executing it on our simulators. Let's go back to
our `hello.c` program:

    #include <stdio.h>

    int main( void )
    {
      printf("hello world!");
    }

We can cross-compile this program like this:

    % riscv32-unknown-elf-gcc -o hello hello.c
    % ./hello

Instead of using `gcc`, which is the native compiler, we are using
`riscv32-unknown-elf-gcc` which is the cross-compiler for RISC-V. Note
that this a general cross-compiler that supports the full RISC-V
instruction set. You can definitely compile complex programs that will
not work on a TinyRV2 simulator. For example, the above program will not
work on a TinyRV2 simulator because it uses `printf` and ASCII character
strings which are not supported.

Let's move to doing cross-compilation using the build system.
Cross-compilation needs its own build directory separate from the build
directory we use for native compilation. We also need to give the
`configure` script a special command line option.

    % mkdir -p $TOPDIR/app/build
    % cd $TOPDIR/app/build
    % ../configure --host=riscv32-unknown-elf

Now let's cross-compile `simple-avg-adhoc`. The `Makefile` takes care of
using `riscv32-unknown-elf-gcc`.

    % cd $TOPDIR/app/build
    % make simple-avg-adhoc
    % riscv32-objdump ./simple-avg-adhoc | less -p "<avg>:"
    ...
    00000254 <avg>:
      254: add   x10, x10, x11
      258: srli  x15, x10, 0x1f
      25c: add   x5,  x15, x10
      260: srai  x10, x5,  0x1
      264: jalr  x0,  x1,  0

You can see it has compiled the `avg` function into five RISC-V
instructions. The division is implemented using a SRAI instruction. The
SRLI instruction and second ADD instruction make sure that integer
division rounds towards zero when averaging negative numbers. The are two
more key parts of the cross-compilation process.

First, the linker script is used to specify how different parts of the
program are placed into the virtual address space. We usually use the
default linker script, but for TinyRV2 we need to be very careful where
we put the code to make sure it starts at the reset vector (i.e., address
0x200). If you are interested, you can see the TinyRV2 linker script
here:

    % cd $TOPDIR/app/scripts
    % cat tinyrv2.ld

Second, the `crt0.S` assembly file is used to specify the assembly
instructions which should be executed when starting the program. We don't
start the program by executing `main`. We start by doing some setup code,
and then that setup code will call `main`. We usually use the default
`crt0.S`, but for TinyRV2 we need our own custom `crt0.S`. If you are
interested, you can see the TinyRV2 `crt0.S` assembly file here:

    % cd $TOPDIR/app/ece4750
    % cat crt0.S

Now we are ready to execute our cross-compiled program on our simulators.
You should always start by executing the program on a functional-level
model of the target system (also called an instruction set architecture
(ISA) simulator). This way we know the program has been cross-compiled
correctly before we try executing the program on our detailed RTL models.
We provide an ISA simulator for you in Lab 4 in `sim/lab4_sys/sys-sim`.
So you can run the cross-compiled program like this:

    % cd $TOPDIR/app/build
    % ../../sim/lab4_sys/sys-sim ./simple-avg-adhoc

To simplify using the system simulator, you can also temporarily add it
to your path like this:

    % export PATH="$TOPDIR/sim/lab4_sys:$PATH"
    % cd $TOPDIR/app/build
    % sys-sim ./simple-avg-adhoc

If our simulators do not support an operating system, how is the program
able to print to the console? If you look in
`app/ece4750/ece4750-wprint.h` and `app/ece4750/ece4750-wprint.c` you
will see that calling `ece4750_wprintf` eventually results in sending
messages to the test harness using the `proc2mngr` CSR. The system
simulator looks for these messages and knows how to display integers,
characters, and strings to the console.

Let's now cross-compile and run our test program on the TinyRV2 ISA
simulator.

    % cd $TOPDIR/app/build
    % make simple-avg-test
    % sys-sim ./simple-avg-test -1
    % sys-sim ./simple-avg-test
    % sys-sim ./simple-avg-test 1

This will run all of our software tests on the TinyRV2 ISA simulator
which gives us confidence that our program has been cross-compiled
correctly (we already know our program works since we tested in
natively!). Notice how you can pass command line arguments to the
cross-compiled program running on the ISA simulator. Again, it is very
convenient to build and run a unit test with a single command like this:

    % cd $TOPDIR/app/build
    % make simple-avg-test && ./simple-avg-test

You can run all of the test cases associated with a specific subproject
like this:

    % cd $TOPDIR/app/build
    % make check-simple

And you can run all of the test cases across all subprojects like this:

    % cd $TOPDIR/app/build
    % make check

Compiling and Cross-Compiling a C Microbenchmark
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Obviously, we want to explore more interesting programs than an integer
average function. Let's look at our element-wise vector-vector addition
microbenchmark. All of our single-core microbenchmarks will be in the
`app/ubmark` directory. Take a look at the implementation of the
benchmark in `app/ubmark/ubmark-vvadd.h` and `app/ubmark/ubmark-vvadd.c`.
Then look at the unit tests in `app/ubmark/ubmark-vvadd-test.c`. We have
tests for positive values, negative values, and different sized input
arrays.

Let's start by testing this microbenchmark natively.

    % cd $TOPDIR/app/build-native
    % make ubmark-vvadd-test
    % ./ubmark-vvadd-test

Then we can cross-compile the microbenchmark and take a look at the
corresponding assembly.

    % cd $TOPDIR/app/build
    % make ubmark-vvadd-test
    % riscv32-objdump ./ubmark-vvadd-test | less -p "<ubmark_vvadd>:"
    ...
    00000ec0 <ubmark_vvadd>:
      ec0: bge   x0,  x13, eec # -----.
      ec4: slli  x13, x13, 0x2 #      |
      ec8: add   x13, x11, x13 #      |
      ecc: lw    x15, 0(x11)   # <-.  |
      ed0: lw    x14, 0(x12)   #   |  |
      ed4: addi  x11, x11, 4   #   |  |
      ed8: addi  x12, x12, 4   #   |  |
      edc: add   x15, x15, x14 #   |  |
      ee0: sw    x15, 0(x10)   #   |  |
      ee4: addi  x10, x10, 4   #   |  |
      ee8: bne   x11, x13, ecc # --'  |
      eec: jalr  x0,  x1,  0   # <----'

We have annoted the assembly to show the control flow. The first BGE
instruction branches directly to the function return if the size is less
than or equal to zero. The SLLI and ADD create a pointer that points to
one past the last element in the array. Then we see the expected loads,
add, stores, and pointer bumps. The key difference from the classic loop
we study in lecture is that the compiler has elimited the instruction
used to decrement the loop counter and is instead simply comparing one of
the array pointers to the pre-calculated "one past the last element"
pointer.

Now let's execute this test program on the TinyRV2 ISA simulator:

    % cd $TOPDIR/app/build
    % sys-sim ./ubmark-vvadd-test

Evaluating a C Microbenchmark
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now that we know our microbenchmark passes all of our tests natively and
on the ISA simulator, we are ready to do an actual evaluation. Take a
look at the evaluation program in `app/ubmark/ubmark-vvadd-eval.c`:

    #include "ece4750.h"
    #include "ubmark-vvadd.h"
    #include "ubmark-vvadd.dat"

    int main( void )
    {
      // Allocate destination array for results

      int* dest = ece4750_malloc( eval_size * (int)sizeof(int) );

      // Run the evaluation

      ece4750_stats_on();
      ubmark_vvadd( dest, eval_src0, eval_src1, eval_size );
      ece4750_stats_off();

      // Verify the results

      for ( int i = 0; i < eval_size; i++ ) {
        if ( dest[i] != eval_ref[i] ) {
          ece4750_wprintf( L"\n FAILED: dest[%d] != eval_ref[%d] (%d != %d)\n\n",
                           i, i, dest[i], eval_ref[i] );
          ece4750_exit(1);
        }
      }

      ece4750_wprintf( L"\n **PASSED** \n\n" );

      // Free destination array

      ece4750_free(dest);

      return 0;
    }

A couple of things to note. The dataset is stored in `ubmark-vvadd.dat`.
We cannot read/write files, so all datasets will be compiled into the
binary using global arrays. The `.dat` file also includes the reference
output so we can verify the microbenchmark has produced the correct
result. We are using `ece4750_malloc` to do dynamic memory allocation. We
are using a very, very simple bump allocator which just allocates dynamic
memory on the heap but never really frees it. Do not try to allocate too
much dynamic memory! Finally, notice how we call `ece4750_stats_on` right
before the function we want to evaluate and `ece4750_stats_off` right
after the function we want to evaluate. These functions write a CSR which
then triggers a signal in the simulator to start or stop collecting
statistics. We call this region the _region of interest_ (ROI).

As always, we need to make sure our evaluation program works natively
before trying to actually execute it on our simulators.

    % cd $TOPDIR/app/build-native
    % make ubmark-vvadd-eval
    % ./ubmark-vvadd-eval

Once we know the microbenchmark works, we can cross-compile it and run it
on our ISA simulator.

    % cd $TOPDIR/app/build
    % make ubmark-vvadd-eval
    % sys-sim ./ubmark-vvadd-eval

We can use the `--stats` command line option to display statistics.

    % cd $TOPDIR/app/build
    % sys-sim --stats ./ubmark-vvadd-eval

Since this is an ISA simulator the number of cycles is not meaningful,
but the number of instructions is useful since it tells you how many
instructions are in the ROI.

Of course, the real goal is to run this microbenchmark on our RTL models.
You will be creating a single-core system in Lab 4, but just for
demonstration purposes, we can show how to do evaluate this
microbenchmark on our single-core system. You should start by confirming
your test program runs correctly on the RTL model of the single-core
system like this:

    % cd $TOPDIR/app/build
    % sys-sim --impl base ./ubmark-vvadd-test

Then you can run the evaluation program on the single-core system. Here
is what it looks like on our single-core system.

    % cd $TOPDIR/app/build
    % sys-sim --impl base --stats ./ubmark-vvadd-eval

      num_cycles        = 4258
      num_inst          = 811
      CPI               = 5.25

      num_icache_access = 912
      num_icache_miss   = 5
      icache_miss_rate  = 0.01

      num_dcache_access = 301
      num_dcache_miss   = 75
      dcache_miss_rate  = 0.25

There are 811 instructions in the ROI and the CPI is 5.25. The
instruction cache miss rate is quite low since there is significant
temporal locality in the vector-vector-add loop. The data cache miss rate
is 25% which is to be expected. This microbenchmark is streaming through
three arrays. The access to the first word on a cache line results in a
miss, and then we have four hits when accessing the next four words.
There are three arrays each with 100 elements, so the number of data
cache accesses is around 300. There is one extra data cache access due to
a few extra instructions before/after the key inner loop. We can look at
the line trace to learn more about the execution of this microbenchmark.

    % cd $TOPDIR/app/build
    % sys-sim --impl base --trace ./ubmark-vvadd-eval > trace.txt

For long traces it is often better to save them to a file. You can search
for `csrw` to jump to where stats are enabled (i.e. the ROI). It can be a
little complicated to analyze the line trace since the loop has been
unrolled and aggressively optimized. This is what the line trace looks
like for an iteration of the loop where the memory accesses miss in the

The `*` right before the F stage means that stats are enabled (i.e., we
are in the ROI). The line trace shows the five-stage pipeline as well as
the cache FSMs. We have edited out the tag state. You can see that all
instruction cache accesses are hitting in the cache, but you can clearly
see the impact of the four-cycle hit latency! Each instruction cache
access must go through the I->TC->RD->W states. The instruction cache
access for the first LW goes to the cache on cycle 497 and it is returned
on cycle 500. The processor pipeline is finally able to decode the LW on
cycle 501. The four-cycle hit latency means the absolute lowest CPI will
be 4. On cycle 502, the LW is in the X stage and sends a data memory
request to the data cache. You can see the data cache go through the
I->TC->RR->RW->RU->RD->W states to handle the miss, and you can see the
refill read request go to main memory on cycle 504 and the refill
response coming back on cycle 505. Finally, the data is returned from
memory on cycle 1056. The second LW and the SW also miss. If we count
when the instruction fetch for the first LW is sent to the icache on
cycle 497 to when the same thing happens for the first LW in the next
iteration on cycle 545, the total number of cycles to execute this
iteration of the loop is 48 for a CPI of 48/8 = 6.

This is what the line trace looks like for the next iteration of the loop
when the memory accesses hit in the data cache.

Notice that for this sequence, each access to the data cache hits and
goes through the I->TC->RD/WR->W states. If we count when the instruction
fetch for the first LW is sent to the icache on cycle 545 to when the
same thing happens for the first LW in the next iteration on cycle 584,
the total number of cycles to execute this iteration of the loop is 39
for a CPI of 39/8 = 4.875.

The arrays in the microbenchmark have a size of 100; 25 of these
iterations will miss in the cache and take roughly 48 cycles and 75 of
these iterations will hit in the cache and take 39 cycles for a total of
25*48+75*39 = 4125 cycles. The actual cycle count is 4258 cycles. The
difference is because sometimes we need to evict cache lines which
increases the miss penalty, and there are some instructions before and
after the loop that need to be executed.

An Accumulate C Microbenchmark
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Try writing an accumulate microbenchmark in the `ubmark-accumulate.c`
file. Compile it natively to verify the tests pass and the evaluation
program works like this:

    % cd $TOPDIR/app/build-native
    % make ubmark-accumulate-test
    % ./ubmark-accumulate-test
    % make ubmark-accumulate-eval
    % ./ubmark-accumulate-eval

Then cross-compile it and look at the disassembly like this:

    % cd $TOPDIR/app/build
    % make ubmark-accumulate-test
    % riscv32-objdump ./ubmark-accumulate-test | less -p "<ubmark_accumulate>:"

Then run those tests on the ISA simulator.

    % cd $TOPDIR/app/build
    % sys-sim ubmark-accumulate-test

Now try the evaluation program on the ISA simulator.

    % cd $TOPDIR/app/build
    % sys-sim ubmark-accumulate-eval
